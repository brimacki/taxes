# taxes
# This repo will look at the US tax system from a very quantitative perspective. I do not yet know what the final direction of this project will be. Currently, the defined problem I will solve is, given the following what are the taxes you will pay:

# 1. Income
# 2. Marital status
# 3. Deductions
# 4. State
