This directory contains a series a text files for tax brackets at the federal level and for all state levels.
The database file should be named [state][year].txt or federal[year].txt.
The [state] entry should be the USPS acronym.
The format of the federal file (for single filers) is as follows, and the state files must follow the same format:

for all brackets
	min	max	percentage
end

Single, federal
numBrackets
0	9525	0.10
...	...	...
500001		0.37

Each file should contain the rates for the different filing statuses available. They should be in the following order:

Single
...
MFS (Married Filing Separately)
...
MFJ (Married Filing Jointly)
...
HoH (Head of Household)

Again, if there is any doubt as to the format then see the federal[year].txt file.
